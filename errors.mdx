When working with the ClashAI API, you’ll inevitably run into errors. Here’s a list of the most common ones, what they mean, and how to fix it.

## Common Error Responses

<Tabs>

<Tab title="401 - Unauthorized">

```json
{
	"error": {
		"message": "Invalid or missing API key",
		"type": "error",
		"tip": "Troubleshoot at: https://discord.gg/RjX2CpdPpd",
		"code": 401
	}
}
```

**What it means:** Your API key is either missing, invalid, or expired.
**How to fix:**

- Double-check your environment variable `CLASHAI_API_KEY`.
- Make sure it’s passed correctly in your code or request headers.
- Generate a new key if needed.

### Example Fixes

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Python">

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

  api_key=os.getenv("CLASHAI_API_KEY"),
  base_url="https://api.clashai.eu/v1"
)
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Node.js">

```javascript

	apiKey: process.env.CLASHAI_API_KEY,
	baseURL: 'https://api.clashai.eu/v1',
})
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="cURL">

```bash
curl https://api.clashai.eu/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLASHAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

</Tab>

</Tabs>

</Tab>

<Tab title="403 - Forbidden">

```html
<html>
	<head>

	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>403 Forbidden</h1>
		<p>Access denied</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

**What it means:** Cloudflare has blocked your request, usually because it detected suspicious or abusive behavior. This often happens if your IP or request pattern triggered a firewall or rate limit rule.

**Typical scenario:** Cloudflare returns an HTML 403 page indicating your request was banned or blocked

**How to fix:**

- Make sure you are not sending too many requests too quickly.
- If you believe this block is a mistake, please open a support ticket so we can investigate and resolve the issue together.

</Tab>

<Tab title="429 - Too Many Requests">

```json
{
	"error": {
		"message": "Rate limit exceeded",
		"type": "rate_limit_error",
		"code": "too_many_requests"
	}
}
```

**What it means:** You’ve hit the API rate limit.
**How to fix:**

- Slow down your requests.
- Implement exponential backoff or retry logic.
- Upgrade your plan if limits are too low.

</Tab>

<Tab title="500 - Internal Server Error">

```json
{
	"error": {
		"message": "Internal server error",
		"type": "server_error",
		"code": "internal_error"
	}
}
```

**What it means:** Something went wrong on the server side.
**How to fix:**

- Retry after a short delay.
- If it persists, contact support with request details.

</Tab>

<Tab title="404 - Not Found">
```json
{
    "error": {
        "message": "Invalid URL (POST /v1/chat/)",
        "code": 404
    }
}
```

**What it means:** The endpoint you are trying to access does not exist, or the resource you're requesting was deleted or never created.

**How to fix:**

- Double-check the URL and HTTP method you're using.
- Make sure the resource (e.g. model, file, deployment) actually exists.
- Refer to the API documentation to verify you're calling the correct endpoint.

## General Tips

- Always log error responses for debugging.
- Use retries with backoff on 429 and 500 errors.
- Never ignore errors — your app will break silently.
- Keep your API key safe; unauthorized errors often stem from key issues.
