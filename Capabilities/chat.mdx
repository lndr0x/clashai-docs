## Quickstart
To generate text from a prompt, you can use the `v1/chat/completions` endpoint. Here's how you can make a request to generate text:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="cURL">
  ```bash
curl https://api.clashai.eu/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLASHAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
     "model": "gpt-4o",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}]
   }'
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
import clashaipy

api_key = os.getenv("CLASHAI_API_KEY")
client = clashaipy.Client(api_key=api_key)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say this is a test!",
        }
    ]
)

print(completion)
	```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JavaScript">
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const apiKey = 'YOUR_CLASHAI_API_KEY';
const url = 'https://api.clashai.eu/v1/chat/completions';

const data = {
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'Say this is a test!'
    }
  ]
};

const headers = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
};

axios.post(url, data, { headers })
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });

```

## Messages

Messages are an array of objects that contain the role and content of the message. The role can be either `user` or `assistant`. Each message can have a different role, which influences how the model might interpret the input.

| Role     | Description                                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| user     | The user who initiates the conversation or provides input |
| assistant| The model's response or generated text                     |
| system   | Special instructions or system-level messages (optional)  |

## Message history

The message history is an array of messages that the model has seen so far. This can be used to provide context to the model when generating text.

		{"role": "user", "content": "It was challenging, but worth it. My legs are sore, but the fresh air made it feel so much better."},
